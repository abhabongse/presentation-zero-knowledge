# Presentation on Zero-Knowledge Protocols

This repository hosts a presentation on zero-knowledge protocols.
It is created as an IPE-compatible PDF document. Try editing the main PDF document file with [IPE extensible drawing editor](http://ipe.otfried.org/).

## Development Notes

First of all, IPE requires LaTeX to be installed.

Style sheets utilized by this IPE document are located inside [styles](styles/) subdirectory. IPE-specific path environment variables are configured via file [ipe.sh](ipe.sh). It assumes that the location of `ipe` is within the path variable `$PATH`.
